# <a name="set-up-use-tax-and-purchase-tax"></a>Set Up Use Tax and Purchase Tax
Sales tax includes taxes that companies pay for using items:  

- Use tax (United States) – Use tax is a United States sales tax that is paid on items that are purchased by a company and are used by that company instead of being sold to a customer. The company must pay sales tax for those items to the government, in the form of use tax.  
- Purchase tax (Canada) – Purchase tax is a Canadian sales tax that is paid by a company on items that are purchased from a vendor. When a company purchases items for use by the company itself, the vendor charges the appropriate sales tax for the items.
