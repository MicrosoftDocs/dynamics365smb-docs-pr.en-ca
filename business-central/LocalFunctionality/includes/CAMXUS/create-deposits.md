> [!NOTE]
> New capabilities for creating bank deposits are available in Business Central 2022 release wave 1 for a lot of country/region versions. If you were using Business Central in the United States, Canada, or Mexico before that release, you might be using the earlier capabilities. You can continue, but the new capabilities will replace the old ones in a future release. To start using the new features right away, your administrator can go to the **Feature Management** page and turn on **Feature Update: Standardized bank reconciliation and deposits**. For more information, see [Create Bank Deposits](../../../bank-create-bank-deposits.md).


You can make bank deposits to maintain a transaction record that contains information that can be applied to outstanding invoices and credit memos.  

The **Deposits** page specifies bank deposit information such as the bank account number, total deposit amount, deposit lines, posting date, document date, department code, currency code, and bank deposit notes. You can use the page to create new bank deposits, post deposits, print deposits, view deposit comments, or view a report that shows the deposit amount to reconcile.

The **Deposit** report displays customer and vendor deposits with the original deposit amount, the amount of the deposit that remains open, and the amount applied. The report also shows the total posted deposit amount to reconcile.

Bank deposit lines contain information about the individual deposited items, such as cheques from customers. This information includes the document date and number, account type and number, and amount. The total of the amounts on the lines must add up to the total amount of the deposit.

After you fill in the deposit information and lines, you must post it in order to update the relevant ledgers, such as the bank ledger, general ledger, or customer ledger. Posted deposits are stored for future reference and can be viewed on the **Posted Deposits** page.
