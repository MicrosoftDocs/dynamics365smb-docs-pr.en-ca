The following troubleshooting reports are available to assist Microsoft Certified Partners with troubleshooting issues:  

-   **License Information** report – This report contains the license number, the name of the licensed user, which application granules they have purchased, and when the license expires, if applicable.  
-   **Data Dictionary** report (report #10315) – This report allows you to print detailed table reference, field reference, and table properties for table objects.  

You must have access to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../../includes/prod_short.md)] Object Designer, which is available only to administrators and only in Business Central Spring 2019 and earlier.
