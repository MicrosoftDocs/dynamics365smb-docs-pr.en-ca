# <a name="set-up-stockkeeping-units"></a>Set Up Stockkeeping Units
You can use stockkeeping units to record information about your items for a specific location or a specific variant code.  

 Stockkeeping units are a supplement to item cards. They do not replace them, although they are related to them. Stockkeeping units allow you to differentiate information about an item for a specific location, such as a warehouse or distribution centre, or a specific variant, such as different shelf numbers and different replenishment information, for the same item.  

## <a name="to-set-up-a-stockkeeping-unit"></a>To set up a stockkeeping unit  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Stockkeeping Units**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  Fill in the fields on the card. The following fields are required: **Item No.**, **Location Code**, and/or **Variant Code**. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]  

When you have set up the first stockkeeping unit for an item, the **Stockkeeping Unit Exists** check box on the **Item** card is selected.  

To create several stockkeeping units for an item, use the **Create Stockkeeping Unit** batch job.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  The information on the **Stockkeeping Unit** card has priority over the **Item** card.

> [!Warning]
> If the SKU is supplied through production, then the **Standard Cost** field is not used when invoicing and adjusting the actual cost of the produced item. Instead, the **Standard Cost** field on the underlying item card is used, and any variances are calculated against the cost shares of that item.<br /><br />
> Because production BOMs and routing cannot be assigned to SKUs, then the unit cost roll-up and the related calculation of cost shares are also not available on SKUs. For more information, see [About Calculating Standard Cost](finance-about-calculating-standard-cost.md)
