There are different ways to customize the application to give you and your colleagues access to the features, functionality, and data that you need most, in a manner that bests suits your daily work. Those who see the changes will depend on what you do, as described in this table.

> In addition to what administrators can customize, users can personalize their pages by adding, moving, or removing fields, freeze panes, parts, and more. For more information, see [Personalizing Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).

> All feature descriptions in user documentation for [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] assume the **Premium** experience, meaning the descriptions cover the full scope of UI elements. Therefore, users with the **Essential** experience may in some topics read about functionality and UI elements that are not visible in their user interface.
