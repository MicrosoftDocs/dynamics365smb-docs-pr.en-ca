# <a name="walkthrough-making-cash-flow-forecasts-by-using-account-schedules"></a>Walkthrough: Making Cash Flow Forecasts by Using Account Schedules

This walkthrough describes how you can use account schedules to make cash flow forecasts. Account schedules perform calculations that cannot be done directly in the chart of cash flow accounts. In the account schedules, you can set up subtotals for cash flow receipts and disbursements. These subtotals can be included in new totals that can then be used in making cash flow forecasts.  

## <a name="about-this-walkthrough"></a>About This Walkthrough

This walkthrough describes the following tasks:  

- Setting up a new cash flow account schedule name.  
- Setting up account schedule lines.

## <a name="setting-up-a-new-column-layout"></a>Setting Up a New Column Layout

Before Ken can print the cash flow forecast, he needs to create the column layout for the numerical information. In the columns, he defines the information that he wants to use from the lines.

- The first column has the number *C10* with the title **Amount** and contains the net change.  
- The second column has the number *C20* with the title **Balance at Date** and contains the transactions for the period.  
- The third column has the number *C30* with the title **Entire Year** and contains the net change in the balances for the entire fiscal year.  
- Finally, he assigns the column layout as the default column layout for the account schedule **Forecast**.  

## <a name="to-set-up-a-new-column-layout"></a>To set up a new column layout

1. In the **Account Schedule Names** window, select the new **Forecast** account schedule name that you have created. On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Edit Column Layout Setup**.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can find the same action in the **Account Schedule** page if you are still editing the **Forecast** account schedule there.

2. Create a new column layout with the name **Cash Flow**.

3. Choose the OK button.

4. Enter each line exactly as shown in the following table.

    |Column No.|Column Header|Column Type|Ledger Entry Type|Amount Type|Show|  
    |----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|----|
    |C10|Amount|Net Change|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C20|Amount until Date|Balance at Date|Entries|Net Amount|Always|  
    |C30|Entire Fiscal Year|Entire Fiscal Year|Entries|Net Amount|Always|
