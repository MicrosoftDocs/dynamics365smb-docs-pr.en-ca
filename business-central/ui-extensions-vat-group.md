# <a name="the-vat-group-management-extension"></a>The GST/HST Group Management Extension

You can join one or more businesses in your country to consolidate GST/HST reporting under a single registration number. This type of arrangement is known as a *GST/HST group*. You can engage with the group as a member or the group representative.

## <a name="forming-a-vat-group"></a>Forming a GST/HST Group
GST/HST group members and the group representative can use the **GST Group Management Setup** assisted setup guide to define their engagement with the group, and create a connection between their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants. The group members will use the connection to submit their GST/HST returns to the group representative. The representative will submit GST/HST to tax authorities on behalf of the group using a single GST/HST return. 

## <a name="vat-group-constellations"></a>GST/HST Group Constellations
Communication happens from group members to the representative. The group representative exposes an API that allows the members to submit their GST returns to the GST/HST group representative. 
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] supports inter-group GST/HST return submissions for companies using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or online, and in any combination. The setup of the communication depends on the constellation. The following sections describe how to set up various group constellations.

The following list shows the recommended order of the steps to set up a GST group:

1. Create the setup in Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Requirements for Authentication](ui-extensions-vat-group.md#requirements-for-authentication).
2. Share the technical information that GST/HST group members and the representative need to connect their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenants. Usually, the GST/HST group representative has this information, such as the name of the GST/HST group representative's environment to which the GST/HST group members will submit Tax.
3. Create users in the GST/HST group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] that GST/HST group members can use to authenticate and connect.
4. Run the **Set up GST Group Management** assisted setup guide to connect the GST/HST group members.

  The guide requires some information from the GST/HST group representative. For more information, see the [GST/HST Group Member Setup](#vat-group-member-setup) section. Make a note of the **Group Member ID** for each GST/HST group member. The representative needs these IDs to add the companies to the GST/HST group.
5. Set up the GST Group Management extension in the GST/HST group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] by using the **Set up GST Group Management** assisted setup guide. 

> [!NOTE]
> To connect to the GST/HST group representative, group members need a user with access to the GST/HST group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The GST/HST group representative must create at least one user for this, however, for security reasons we recommended that you create a user for each GST/HST group member. Make sure to distribute the credentials for these users to GST/HST group members in a secure way.

## <a name="understanding-the-vat-group-management-setup"></a>Understanding the GST/HST Group Management Setup

The GST group representative exposes an API that GST group members can use to connect to their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant and submit tax returns. GST group members will often use [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] in separate Azure Active Directory tenants. Therefore, more setup is needed to make a connection between the GST group member and representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. 
  
GST/HST group members connect to the representative by calling a web service on the GST/HST group representative tenant. The caller must be authenticated using OAuth. When the GST Group Management extension is set up, you will be asked to authenticate to the GST/HST group representative to get and save an access token. This access token is used when submitting GST returns to the GST group representative. 

Authentication is handled by Azure Active Directory, so your setup must be made in the GST group representative's Azure Active Directory to allow connections. An Azure Active Directory app registration must be configured with access to the GST group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This is also true if the GST/HST group representative is using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises. Additionally, you must configure Single Sign-On if the GST/HST group representative is using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

> [!NOTE]
> For a limited time, authentication using a web service access key is also supported. For more information, see [Deprecated Features in 2021 release wave 1](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/upgrade/deprecated-features-w1#deprecated-features-in-2021-release-wave-1).

## <a name="requirements-for-authentication"></a>Requirements for Authentication 
When the GST group representative is using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online or on-premises, GST group members use Azure Active Directory to authenticate when they submit GST returns to the GST group representative. If the GST/HST group members are also using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, the GST/HST group member can authenticate using the designated user credentials and the endpoint information. For more information, see [GST/HST Group Member Setup](ui-extensions-vat-group.md#vat-group-member-setup).

GST group members who have [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises must set up an app registration in Azure Active Directory for the GST group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant. The app registration will enable the GST group representative's [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online to authenticate the group member. For more information, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

When you create the app registration in Azure Active Directory, you must specify the following.

* In the **Authentication** section, add **Web** as a platform, and use the following **Redirect URL**: https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm.
* In the **Authentication** section, in the option to select **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)**.
* In the **Certificates & secrets** section, create a new client secret and note the value. The GST/HST group members will need the secret when they set up the connection to the group representative.
* In the **API permissions** section, add permissions to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Enable delegated access to **Financials.ReadWrite.All** and **user_impersonation**.
* In the **Overview** section, note the **Application (client) ID**. The GST/HST group members will need the ID when they set up the connection to the group representative. 

## <a name="vat-group-member-setup"></a>GST/HST Group Member Setup
Set up the GST/HST group member by starting the **Set up GST Group Management** assisted setup guide. 

> [!NOTE]
> Before you get started, contact the GST/HST group representative for the following information about their [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] tenant:
>
> * The API URL
> * The name of their company 
> * Client ID
> * Client secret
> * Sign in credentials for the dedicated user 

1. To define the company's GST/HST group role, choose **Member**, then choose **Next**.
2. Copy the value of the **Group Member ID** field, then share it with the GST/HST group representative so they can add your company as an approved member of the group.
3. Add the **API URL** from the GST/HST group representative. Typically, the URL is formatted as follows: `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/[TENANT-ID]/[ENVIRONMENTNAME]`. For example, `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/v2.0/907869c3-b252-4aca-b9cb-17a15d25477b/UKRepresentative`. 
4. Add the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] company name of the GST group representative, such as *CRONUS UK Ltd*.
5. Choose **Authentication Type**, choose **OAuth2**, and then choose **Next**.
6. In the **Client ID** field, enter the ID provided by the GST/HST group representative.
7. In the **Client Secret provided by the GST Group representative** field, enter the secret provided by the GST/HST group representative.
8. In the **OAuth 2.0 Authority Endpoint** field, enter *https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2*.
9. In the **OAuth 2.0 Resource URL** field, enter *https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/*.
10. In the **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URL** field, enter *https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm*. 
11. When you have specified the various fields, choose **Next**, then enter the user credentials that were provided by the GST/HST group representative.
12. Choose the GST/HST report configuration that you use to report GST/HST to authorities in your country.

  For example, in the United Kingdom, the GST/HST report configuration would be set up to report GST/HST to HMRC. The GST Group Management extension copies this setup, but replaces the submission codeunit with one that supports submission to the GST group representative rather than the tax authorities. The codeunit is provided by Microsoft. When done, choose **Next**.

## <a name="using-the-vat-group-management-features"></a>Using the GST Group Management Features

GST/HST group members use the standard processes to prepare GST returns. The only difference is to choose the **VATGROUP** report version, which submits the GST return to the GST/HST group representative rather than the authorities. For more information, see [About the GST/HST Return report](finance-how-report-vat.md#about-the-vat-return-report).

The following sections describe the tasks that GST/HST group representatives must perform.

### <a name="vat-group-submissions"></a>GST/HST Group Submissions

The **GST/HST Group Submissions** page lists the GST returns that members have submitted. The page serves as a draft location for the submissions until the GST/HST group representative includes them in a GST return for the group. You can open the submissions to review the GST for the individual boxes reported by the GST/HST group member.

### <a name="creating-a-group-vat-return"></a>Creating a Group GST/HST Return

To report GST/HST on behalf of the group, on the **GST/HST Returns** page, create a GST/HST return for your company only. Afterward, include the most recent GST submissions from GST/HST group members by choosing the **Include Group GST** action.  

When the GST/HST Group representative's GST Return has been submitted to the authorities on behalf of the entire group, you will normally run the **Calculate and Post GST Settlement** action. This action closes open GST/HST Entries and transfers amounts to the GST/HST Settlement account. Currently, this action does not take the group submissions into account. This means that only the GST Entries of the GST/HST Group representative company will be posted. The GST/HST Group member submission amounts must be posted to the GST settlement amount manually, so that the GST/HST Group representative's GST Settlement account will reflect the liability of what was reported to authorities. This behaviour will change in an upcoming update of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], so the entire group GST/HST (the Total Amount on Report Lines on the GST/HST Return) will be settled. 

> [!NOTE]
> GST/HST group members can correct submitted GST returns as long as the group representative has not released the GST return for the group. To make a correction, the GST/HST group member must create a new GST return for the GST return period and submit it to the GST/HST group representative. On the GST/HST group representative's side, the latest GST return will be included on the **GST Returns** page. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The GST/HST group functionality is only supported in those markets where [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] uses a GST/HST framework that consists of GST/HST returns and GST/HST return periods. You cannot use GST/HST groups in other markets that have other implementations of local GST/HST reporting, such as Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland.
